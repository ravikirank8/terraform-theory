🛠️ Project Overview
You want to deploy a basic Web App + Database setup. Here's a simple architecture:

Users → Internet → EC2 (Web Server) → RDS (Database)

🔧 Step-by-Step Manual Setup (via AWS Console or CLI)
1. Create a VPC (Optional for isolation)
Or use the default VPC for simplicity.

🧪 Optional Next Step: Import to Terraform
Now that you manually created everything, you can use Terraformer or terraform import to migrate it into Terraform:

Example using Terraformer:

terraformer import aws \
  --resources=ec2,rds \
  --regions=us-east-1

This will:

Auto-generate .tf files for EC2 and RDS
Import them into Terraform state

✅ Advantages of Using Terraformer
| Advantage                          | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🚀 **Fast Migration**              | Automatically scans and converts existing cloud infrastructure into `.tf` files and Terraform state. Saves tons of time vs. writing everything manually. |
| 🧠 **Supports Multiple Providers** | Works with AWS, GCP, Azure, Alibaba Cloud, Kubernetes, etc. Helpful for multi-cloud setups.                                                              |
| 🗂️ **Auto-Imports State**         | It not only generates Terraform code but also imports resources into state. This means Terraform can manage them right away.                             |
| 🧾 **Good for Documentation**      | Provides a full snapshot of current infrastructure, which helps understand what's deployed.                                                              |
| ⚙️ **Filter Options**              | You can filter by resource type, ID, or tag to target specific resources. Useful for large-scale environments.    |

❌ Disadvantages of Using Terraformer
| Disadvantage                                    | Description                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔧 **Generated Code Needs Cleanup**             | The `.tf` files may be verbose, redundant, or hard to reuse. You'll likely need to refactor for readability and modularity. |
| 📦 **Lack of Modules**                          | It generates raw resource blocks, not modular or DRY code. You need to organize it yourself post-export.                    |
| 🛠️ **Not 100% Accurate for Complex Resources** | Some advanced configurations (e.g., lifecycle rules, conditional logic, dependencies) may not get captured correctly.       |
| 🧪 **State Management Caution**                 | You can accidentally import into a new state file. Merging into an existing production state file requires care.            |
| ⌛ **Slow for Large Environments**               | Importing hundreds of resources can take time and sometimes fail mid-way.                                                   |

✅ YES, but with precautions.
Use it to bootstrap the project, not as the final source of truth.

Best Practices for Production Use:
✔️ Use Terraformer to export the current infrastructure

🧹 Clean and refactor the generated .tf files

Use modules

Remove unused fields

Simplify repeated code

🧪 Test in a dev/staging environment before applying changes in production

🔐 Handle secrets and sensitive info manually (Terraformer might expose DB passwords or IAM keys in plain text)

🗃️ Merge imported state carefully if integrating into an existing Terraform-managed project

⚠️ Not ideal for:
Complex infrastructure with conditional logic (e.g., dynamic blocks, for_each)

Resources created with advanced orchestration tools

Terraform projects already modularized or following strict IaC design

✅ When to Use Terraformer

| Scenario                           | Use Terraformer?                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Migrating large existing AWS infra | ✅ Yes                                 |
| Starting fresh with IaC            | ❌ No (write clean Terraform manually) |
| Creating reusable modules          | ❌ Not ideal (clean up needed)         |
| Auditing current cloud setup       | ✅ Yes                                 |
| Dev/Test environment automation    | ✅ Yes                                 |
