ðŸ§  What Are Local Values in Terraform?
Local values in Terraform are like temporary variables used to simplify your code.

They help you:

Avoid repeating expressions

Make code cleaner and easier to read

Group logic or calculations in one place

âœ… Syntax of locals
locals {
  name         = "web-app"
  environment  = "dev"
  full_name    = "${local.name}-${local.environment}"
}

ðŸ§© Summary: Local Values in Terraform
| Feature       | Description                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Defined with  | `locals {}` block                   |
| Used as       | `local.<name>`                      |
| Purpose       | Clean, reusable logic & expressions |
| Not persisted | Only used inside the current module |

Example : 

ðŸ§¾ This will create an S3 bucket like:
myproject-us-east-1-bucket

variable "region" {
  default = "us-east-1"
}

locals {
  project_name = "myproject"
  bucket_name  = "${local.project_name}-${var.region}-bucket"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = local.bucket_name
  acl    = "private"
}

ðŸŽ¯ Why Use locals?


| âœ… Benefit          | ðŸ’¬ Explanation                               |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Reuse logic        | Define once, use multiple times              |
| Clean code         | Replace long/complex expressions             |
| Easier to maintain | Update in one place instead of many          |
| Helpful in loops   | Preprocess lists/maps for `for_each`/`count` |
