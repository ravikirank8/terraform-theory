ðŸ§  What is a Terraform Workspace?

| Feature          | Value                                               |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose          | Manage multiple environments with one codebase      |
| State Management | Each workspace has its own `.tfstate`               |
| Limitations      | Doesnâ€™t change backend/provider setup automatically |

A Terraform workspace is a way to manage multiple states for the same configuration.
Because each workspace has its own Terraform state


It lets you use the same .tf code for different environments like:

âœ… dev

âœ… staging

âœ… prod

Each workspace has its own state file, so resources don't conflict with each other.
